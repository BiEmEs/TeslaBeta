# TODO list

- finish implementing Frame.java and all the classes that depend from it.
- fix Slider.java
- review the HUD classes and fix pontential syntax/porting issues
- actually initialize all modules (most won't be launched as of now)

hopefully after fixing everything we can actually build successfully and run the client.
